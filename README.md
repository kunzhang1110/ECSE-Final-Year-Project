# ECSE-Final-Year-Project
**Monash University**

*Semester 1 and 2, 2013*

## Description
The project is about designing a current-controlled AC-AC inverter and developing programs for controlling and setting this inverter. The inverter is used for motor control and other applications. The innovation of this project involves real-time controlling of the inverter parameters and the control methodology applied. The project also creates fast communication between the inverter and userâ€™s terminals, such as a PC. 

## Environment
* Simulation: Matlab Simulink
* Implementation: Arduino and Atmel PWM controller(AT90PWM3B)
* PCB Board: Altium Designer
